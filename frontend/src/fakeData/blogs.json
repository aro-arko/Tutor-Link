    "description": "Personalized learning is an educational approach that aims to customize learning for each student's strengths, needs, skills, and interests. Each student gets a learning plan that's based on what they know and how they learn best. Personalized learning doesn't replace an Individualized Education Program (IEP) or a 504 plan. Instead, it offers a way to help all students succeed, including those with learning and thinking differences.",
